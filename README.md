# JavaScript Journey 
This is where I will share my journey with JavaScript.<br>
I will be using Scrimba to learn JavaScript and I will share each project on here <br>
The course is 10 hours long and my goal is to complete it in one weekend

Day 1 ➡️ Used scrimba to built an interactive counter that displays each save.
